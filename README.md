# 🛰️ GTFS Journey Reconstruction Engine

This project reconstructs a public transit journey using a combination of real-time GPS data and GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) datasets. It identifies route, trip, and stop information based on a user-provided GPS coordinate and timestamp, and validates journey details using proximity-based matching.
